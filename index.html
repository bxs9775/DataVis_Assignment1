    <h1>FakeDroid App Chart Story</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In January 2019, FakeDroid released statistics on app purchases in the FakeDroid AppStore. The data contains the all-time number of downloads of each app, the average rating of the app, and the 30 day retention rate (how many users kept the app after 30 days).  We decided to look at the data for the 20 most downloaded free apps with an average rating above 4.5, and see if any patterns emerged.</p>

    <h2>What We Found</h2>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>

    <p>Even though all the apps displayed have high average ratings, the number of downloads for each app varies significantly. The apps Cardonia and Trippledex have less than 100,000 downloads, whereas the highest downloaded app, DoubleyDo, has 990,365 which is close to 1,000,000. All the apps studied have high user retention. All of these apps have 30 day retention rates above 70%. Four apps have a retention rating above 90%: Span, Cardify, Trippledex, and Trancef. However, most of the apps have a retention rate between 78% and 86%. Overall, the FakeDroid AppStore continues to have significant downloads and purchases. Representatives of FakeDroid Inc. say they are happy about the AppStoreâ€™s growth, and hope for further growth after they release their new phone, the FakeDroid 404, later this spring.</p>
